?What is .NET ToolStrip Customizer?
**********************************

.NET ToolStrip Customizer is a lightweight and easy to use application 
designed to help you generate custom color tables (in C# and VB.NET) 
for standard .NET Framework ToolStrip controls: toolbars, menus, 
pop-ups, status bars. It also has a built-in color schemes that you 
can use in your own WinForms applications: ?Office 2007?, ?Office 2003?, 
?Visual Studio 2010?, etc.

Why I Need This?
****************

At present, there is no free alternative for .NET WinForms standard 
ToolStrip controls. The main problem is that these controls have only 
2 built-in themes: "System" and "Professional", and sometimes they 
both look ugly. But ToolStrip controls are not so bad--they are customizable 
and have a support for alternative renderers. For instance, programmers can 
override methods of ToolStripProfessionalRenderer class and provide their 
own colors for ToolStrips using ColorTable classes. However, these classes 
have more than 50 properties (for each color), and it is very difficult to 
fill all of them with colors (often in ARGB format) by hand. This tool can 
automate this process and generate ColorTable classes for your projects.
